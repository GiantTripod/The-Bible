**1. Hello World:** (Very Easy) Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```
	
```

**2. Number Addition:** (Easy) Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

```
	
```

**3. Odd or Even:** (Easy) Write a program that takes a number as input and prints "Even" if it is even, "Odd" if it is odd, and "Neither" if it is zero.

```
	
	
```

**4. Minimum of Three:** (Easy) Write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the smallest number.

```
	
```

**5. Reverse a String:** (Medium) Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the reversed string.

```
	
```

**6. Palindrome Checker:** (Medium) Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).

```
	
```

**7. Find the Factorial:** (Medium) Write a program that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial.

```
	
```

**8. Fibonacci Sequence:** (Medium) Write a program that generates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55).



**Bonus:**

- Implement these problems using different functions and loops.
- Add error handling to check for invalid input.
- Make the programs more interactive with user prompts and menus.

**1. Guessing Game (Very Easy):** Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. Let the user guess the number within 5 attempts. Use `if` statements for feedback and print a congratulatory message if guessed correctly.

```
	
```

**2. Area & Perimeter Calculator (Easy):** Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and calculates its area and perimeter. Use basic operators and print the results.

```
	
```

**3. Odd or Even? (Easy):** Write a function that takes a number as input and returns True if it's even and False if it's odd. Use the modulo operator (`%`) for checking evenness.

```
	
```

**4. List Sorter (Medium):** Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order. Use a loop and conditional statements to achieve this. You can explore different sorting algorithms later.

```
	
```

**5. Vowel Counter (Medium):** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels it contains. Use a loop and `in` operator to check for vowels.

```
	
```

**6. Password Validator (Medium):** Write a program that asks the user for a password and checks if it's valid. The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. Use appropriate conditions and string methods.

```
	
```

**7. Sentence Analyzer (Hard):** Write a program that takes a sentence as input and analyzes it. Find the number of words, the average word length, and the most frequent letter. Use string methods and loops for parsing and counting.

```
	
```

**8. Fibonacci Sequence (Hard):** Write a function that takes a number `n` as input and generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Use recursion or loop with memoization to achieve this.

```
	
```

### Easy:

5. Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Take the length and width as input from the user.
6. Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
7. Use a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.
8. Define a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs representing information about your dog.

### Medium:

9. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.
10. Create a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
11. Implement a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers based on user input.
12. Write a program that finds the largest number in a list.

### Hard:

13. Create a class called `Person` with attributes for name and age. Create an object of this class and print its details.
14. Write a program to find all prime numbers between 1 and 50.
15. Implement a guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it.
16. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
