### Very Hard:

17. Implement a text-based adventure game using functions and conditional statements.
18. Write a program to sort a list of numbers in ascending order without using built-in functions.
19. Create a program that simulates a basic file system with commands like create file, delete file, create directory, etc.
20. Build a simple web scraper in Python that extracts information from a website.

**1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Challenging):** Write a program that implements a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game with two human players. Use a multidimensional list to represent the board and employ turn-based logic with user input handling.

```
	
```

**2. Hangman Game (Challenging):** Write a program that implements the classic Hangman game. Let the user guess letters in a secret word while avoiding exceeding a predetermined number of wrong guesses. Use string manipulation and conditional logic to manage the gameplay.

```
	
```


**3. List Statistics:** (Challenging) Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation.

```
	
```

**4. Guessing Game:** (Challenging) Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it within 5 tries. Give the user hints like "higher" or "lower" after each guess.
